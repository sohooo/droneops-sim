# Best Practices for Crafting Compelling Demos

Effective demos follow a clear story and highlight the simulator's strengths. Use the guidelines below when shaping new scenarios or adapting existing story templates.

## Define a Clear Narrative
- Anchor the demo on a simple mission with a beginning, midpoint, and resolution.
- Introduce the objective early so viewers know what success looks like.
- Use built-in story arcs (e.g., escort, search-and-rescue) as starting points and tailor the details to your audience.

## Focus the Scope
- Limit the runtime to a few minutes so the audience can follow the action.
- Showcase only the features that serve the story; extra complexity dilutes the message.

## Highlight Key Moments
- Plan two or three inflection points such as enemy encounters, battery warnings, or mission updates.
- Provide visual cues in Grafana or logs so each moment is easy to spot.
- Use simulation state panels to call out communication reliability dips, rising sensor noise, or when chaos mode is enabled.

## Demonstrate Resilience
- Include a failure or unexpected event and show how the system recovers.
- Keep a reset path handy so the demo can restart quickly if something goes wrong.

## Rehearse the Flow
- Practice the full demo to confirm timing and verify that telemetry and dashboards line up with the narrative.
- Document prerequisites and exact commands so others can reproduce the same experience.
