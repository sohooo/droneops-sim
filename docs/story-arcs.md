# Built-in Story Arcs

The simulator includes predefined mission patterns to accelerate scenario design. Each arc follows the classic narrative flow of **setup**, **escalation**, **climax**, and **resolution**. The YAML files in `config/` provide ready-to-use examples.

## Escort
- **Mission**: Protect a vulnerable convoy as it travels to the forward operating base.
- **Sample**: `config/scenario_escort.yaml`

## Search and Rescue
- **Mission**: Locate and recover a downed pilot before hostile forces arrive.
- **Sample**: `config/scenario_search_and_rescue.yaml`

## Defensive Stand
- **Mission**: Hold a critical relay station against waves of hostile drones.
- **Sample**: `config/scenario_defensive_stand.yaml`
